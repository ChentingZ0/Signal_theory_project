### Project 1:
- PartA: 
1. Analyze the impact of the length of sequences on the approximation of original distribution
2. Analyze the impact of the correlation coefficient on the shape of the joint pdf of two-dimensional Gaussian 
variables.
- PartB:
1. Analyze the impact of the noise attached to sinusoid signals based on periodogram 
2. Derive and plot the power spectrum and ACF of AR(1) signals.

### Project 2:

1. Design an equalizer to equalize the received signal and then decode the encrypted image using the reconstructed key.
2. Define a linear MMSE estimator using a FIR filter and select the best filter order from the known training sequence.
3. Add random bit errors to test the limited bit errors through which the decoder could not decode the image anymore
